# raid0source-fixed
- You need to add **ui.cc, ui.hh, autoclicker.cpp, and autoclicker.hpp** yourself. I removed them because I was using this source for educational purposes and added my own files instead.
- If you don't know how to add them, download the original raid0source from channelread0's GitHub. Then copy **ui.cc, ui.hh, autoclicker.cpp, and autoclicker.hpp** from there and paste them into this source.

# required
- Download cpr.lib using vcpkg. If you're not familiar with how to do that, ask ChatGPT.

# injector
- I couldnâ€™t fix the injector source code, so you'll have to fix it yourself.
